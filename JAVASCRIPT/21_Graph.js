/*ðŸ§© A Graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of nodes/vertices and edges which connects them.

Usage: 
Google Maps - where Cities(Nodes) and Roads(Edges)
SocialMedia sites - where users/group/page = (node) and where links/join a group/like a page = a new (edge) is created for that relationship

ðŸ§© Graph Representation:
Graphs are commonly represented in two ways:
1. Adjacency Matrix - An adjacency matrix is a 2D array of V x V vertices. Each row and column represent a vertex.
        B
       / \
      A   C

const matrix = [
    [0, 1, 0],          //A is not connected to A, connected to B and not to C
    [1 ,0, 1],
    [0, 1, 0]
]

2. Adjacency List - Vertices are stored in a map like data structure and every vertex stores a list of its adjacent vertices (more efficient bcz inserting and searching O(1) whereas in matrix its O(n)). Can store weight of edges
        B
       / \
      A   C

const adjacent = {
    'A' : ['B'],
    'B' : ['A', 'B'],
    'C' : ['B']
}
