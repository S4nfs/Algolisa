<h1 align="center">"Algolisa - A Beautiful World of Agile Algorithms"</h1>

## Description

This repository provides an opportunity to solve questions about Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using JavaScript. Some questions come from my personal interview experience at Paytm, AWS, and IBM. It has almost an unknown number of questions with different approaches, and I will be adding more to it, including topics like Google search, memoization, ML and many more.

Please run each program seperately, and approach carefully when debugging. It is important to directly experience and solve various problem situations that may arise in the process of solving the algorithm. This will help you develop a deeper understanding of JavaScript and DSA.

Personal Note: Enjoy building your own algorithms and solving real-world problems instead of just rat racing where no one wins in the end.
