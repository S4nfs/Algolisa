            <div id="timelinepoints">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1969</strong> Born in December 28 1969 Helsinki, Finland</li>
                    <li><strong>1979</strong> At the age of 10, Linus started writing programs in BASIC on his maternal
                        grandfather’s Commodore Vic 20. This is when he discovered his love for computers and
                        programming.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>1991</strong> In early 1991, unhappy with MS-DOS and MINIX, Torvalds wanted to buy a
                        UNIX
                        system. Luckily for us, he didn’t have enough money. So he decided to make his own clone of
                        UNIX,
                        from scratch.</li>
                    <li><strong>1993</strong> In 1993, when he was teaching at the University of Helsinki, he gave the
                        task
                        of composing email as homework to the students. Yeah, composing emails were a big deal back
                        then.

                        A female student named Tove Monni completed the task by sending him an email asking him out on a
                        date. He accepted and three years later the first of their three daughters was born.</li>
                    <li><strong>1995</strong> Linus moved to the US in 1997 and settled there with his wife Tove and
                        their
                        three daughters. </li>
                    <li><strong>2000</strong> In 2000, Apple’s founder Steve Jobs invited him to work on Apple’s macOS.
                        Linus refused the lucrative offer and continued to work on the Linux kernel.</li>
                    <li><strong>2005</strong> He also created Git, a version control system that is extensively used in
                        software development worldwide.Till 2005, (then) proprietary service BitKeeper was used for
                        Linux
                        kernel development. When Bitkeeper shut down its free service, Linus Torvalds created Git on his
                        own
                        because none of the other version control systems met his needs.</li>
                    <li><strong>2018</strong>
                        In 2018, Torvalds took a break from Linux kernel development to improve his behavior. This was
                        done
                        just before he signed the controversial code of conduct for Linux kernel developers.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>2010</strong>He became a US citizen in 2010. At present, he works full-time on the Linux
                        kernel as part of the Linux Foundation.</li>
