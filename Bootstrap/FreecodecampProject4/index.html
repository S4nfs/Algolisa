            <article>
                <p>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web
                    Services (AWS) Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you
                    can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few
                    virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. Amazon EC2
                    enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in requirements or spikes in popularity, reducing
                    your need to forecast traffic.</p>
            </article><br>
            <h4>Amazon EC2 provides the following features:</h4><br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Virtual computing environments, known as instances</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Various configurations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity for your instances, known
                        as instance types</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>HPreconfigured templates for your instances, known as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), that package
                        the bits you need for your server (including the operating system and additional software)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Storage volumes for temporary data that's deleted when you stop, hibernate, or terminate your
                        instance, known as instance store volumes</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Multiple physical locations for your resources, such as instances and Amazon EBS volumes, known
                        as Regions and Availability Zones</p>

                    To create an AWS account:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Open <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">https://aws.amazon.com/</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Follow the online instructions.
                        Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code
                        on the phone keypad.
