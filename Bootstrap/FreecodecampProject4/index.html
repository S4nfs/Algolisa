            </header><br>
            <article>
                <p>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web
                    Services (AWS) Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you
                    can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few
                    virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. Amazon EC2
                    enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in requirements or spikes in popularity, reducing
                    your need to forecast traffic.</p>
            </article><br>
            <h4>Amazon EC2 provides the following features:</h4><br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Virtual computing environments, known as instances</p>

                <li>

                    To create an AWS account:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Open <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">https://aws.amazon.com/</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Follow the online instructions.
                        Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code
                        on the phone keypad.

                    <li>
                        Generate a key pair with a third-party tool of your choice. For example, you can use
                        ssh-keygen (a tool provided with the standard OpenSSH installation). Alternatively, Java,
                        Ruby, Python, and many other programming languages provide standard libraries that you can
                        use to create an RSA or ED25519 key pair. <p>The private key must be in the PEM format. For
                            example, use <code>ssh-keygen -m PEM</code> to generate the OpenSSH key in the PEM
                            format.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Save the public key to a local file. For example, <code>~/.ssh/my-key-pair.pub</code>. The
                        file name extension for this file is not important.

                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Save the private key to a local file that has the <code>.pem</code> extension. For example,
                        <code>~/.ssh/my-key-pair.pem</code>.
                        <p></p>

                        <p>
                        <h6><b>Important:</b></h6>

                        Save the private key file in a safe place. You'll need to provide the name of your public
                        key when you launch an instance, and the corresponding private key each time you connect to
                        the instance.
                        </p>
                    </li><br>
                    <p>After you have created the key pair, use one of the following methods to import your public
                        key to Amazon EC2.</p>

                <h2>Create a security group</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Security groups act as a firewall for associated instances, controlling both inbound and outbound
                traffic at the instance level. You must add rules to a security group that enable you to connect
                to your instance from your IP address using SSH. You can also add rules that allow inbound and
                outbound HTTP and HTTPS access from anywhere.
            </p>
            <p>that if you plan to launch instances in multiple Regions, you'll need to create a security group
                in each Region. For more information about Regions, see Regions and Zones.</p>
            <h6><b>To create a security group with least privilege:</b></h6>
            <ul>
                <li>Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.</li>
                <li>From the top navigation bar, select a Region for the security group. Security groups are
                    specific to a Region, so you should select the same Region in which you created your key
                    pair.</li>
                <li>

                    In the left navigation pane, choose Security Groups.
                </li>
                <li>

                    Choose Create security group.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For Inbound rules, create rules that allow specific traffic to reach your instance. For
                    example, use the following rules for a web server that accepts HTTP and HTTPS traffic. For
                    more examples, see Security group rules for different use cases.
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                            Choose My IP to automatically add the public IPv4 address of your local computer.
                        </li>
                        <li>Choose Custom and specify the public IPv4 address of your computer or network in
                            CIDR notation. To specify an individual IP address in CIDR notation, add the routing
                            suffix <code>/32</code>, for example, <code>203.0.113.25/32</code>
                            . If your company or your router allocates addresses from a range, specify the
                            entire range, such as <code>203.0.113.0/24</code>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>

                    For Outbound rules, keep the default rule, which allows all outbound traffic.
                </li>
                <li>

                    Choose Create security group.

                <p>You can launch a Linux instance using the AWS Management Console as described in the
                    following procedure. This tutorial is intended to help you launch your first instance
                    quickly, so it doesn't cover all possible options. For more information about the advanced
                    options, see Launch an instance using the Launch Instance Wizard. For information about
                    other ways to launch your instance, see Launch your instance.

                        The Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) page displays a list of basic configurations,
                        called Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), that serve as templates for your instance. Select
                        an HVM version of Amazon Linux 2. Notice that these AMIs are marked "Free tier
                        eligible."

                        The <code>t2.micro</code> instance type is eligible for the free tier. In Regions where
                        <code>t2.micro</code> is unavailable, you can use a <code>t3.micro</code> instance under
