# üß† Knowledge-Based Agents & Logical Inference in AI

This project explains how AI systems can use **formal logic** to represent knowledge and perform **reasoning**. The main focus is on **propositional logic**, **model checking**, and **inference** to create **knowledge-based agents**. Logic-based AI uses formal logic and symbolic rules to draw conclusions, while LLMs use statistical associations in natural language learned from data.

## üîë Key Concepts

| Concept                   | Summary                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Knowledge-Based Agent** | AI that stores facts (knowledge) and uses logic to derive new conclusions.       |
| **Propositional Logic**   | Logic involving true/false statements and connectives (AND, OR, NOT, etc).       |
| **Logical Connectives**   | Tools to combine/modify propositions: ¬¨ (NOT), ‚àß (AND), ‚à® (OR), ‚Üí (IF), ‚Üî (IFF). |
| **Model**                 | A possible world ‚Äî an assignment of truth values to all propositions.            |
| **Entailment (‚ä®)**        | If KB (knowledge base) is true, then a query Œ± is also always true.              |
| **Inference**             | The process of deriving new facts from existing knowledge.                       |
| **Model Checking**        | Exhaustively check all possible models to verify entailment.                     |
| **Knowledge Engineering** | The process of structuring domain knowledge into logic form for AI.              |

## üìö Logical Connectives and Truth Tables

| Connective        | Symbol | Description           | Truth Table                              |
| ----------------- | ------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Not**           | ¬¨P     | Negation              | ¬¨True = False<br>¬¨False = True           |
| **And**           | P ‚àß Q  | Conjunction           | True only when P = True, Q = True        |
| **Or**            | P ‚à® Q  | Inclusive Disjunction | False only when both P and Q are False   |
| **Implication**   | P ‚Üí Q  | "If P then Q"         | False only when P = True, Q = False      |
| **Biconditional** | P ‚Üî Q  | "P if and only if Q"  | True when both are the same (T-T or F-F) |

## üîÅ Inference Rules

| Rule Name                       | Formal Notation                          | Description                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Modus Ponens**                | P ‚Üí Q, P ‚ä¢ Q                             | If P implies Q and P is true, then Q is true      |
| **And Elimination**             | P ‚àß Q ‚ä¢ P<br>P ‚àß Q ‚ä¢ Q                   | From P and Q, you can infer P and Q separately    |
| **Double Negation**             | ¬¨¬¨P ‚ä¢ P                                  | Two NOTs cancel out ‚Äî "not not P" means P is true |
| **Implication Elimination**     | P ‚Üí Q ‚ä¢ ¬¨P ‚à® Q                           | "If P then Q" is equivalent to "not P or Q"       |
| **(Optional) De Morgan's Laws** | ¬¨(P ‚àß Q) ‚ä¢ ¬¨P ‚à® ¬¨Q<br>¬¨(P ‚à® Q) ‚ä¢ ¬¨P ‚àß ¬¨Q | NOT distributes over AND/OR                       |

## üõ† Core Operations

| Operation     | Description                                                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TELL(KB, œÜ)` | Adds a sentence œÜ to the knowledge base (i.e., injects new knowledge). |
| `ASK(KB, Œ±)`  | Queries whether a sentence Œ± logically follows from the KB.            |

> In practice, `ASK` triggers an **inference algorithm** (e.g., model checking or logical deduction) to verify if `KB ‚ä® Œ±`.

## KB ‚ä® Œ± ‚áî In every model where KB is true, Œ± is also true.

## üí° Examples from the Project

### Example 1: Harry Potter Logic

- **Facts:**
  - If it didn‚Äôt rain, then Harry visited Hagrid.
  - Harry visited either Hagrid or Dumbledore, but not both.
  - Harry visited Dumbledore.
- **Inferred:**
  - Harry did **not** visit Hagrid.
  - Therefore, it **did** rain.

### Example 2: Clue Game

- Represented suspects, weapons, and rooms using logic symbols.
- Encoded knowledge like:
  - Only one suspect, one room, and one weapon is correct.
  - Some cards are known (e.g., ‚ÄúI have the revolver‚Äù ‚Üí revolver is not in the envelope).
- Used inference to deduce the solution.

### Example 3: Logic Puzzle (Harry Potter House Sorting)

- Created 16 propositional symbols for 4 people √ó 4 houses.
- Encoded constraints: only one house per person, one person per house.
- Added clues and used inference to find each character‚Äôs house.

### Example 4: Mastermind Game

- Used logical inference to deduce color positions.
- Built a solver using propositional logic and model checking.

## üßÆ Limitation of Model Checking

- Model checking is exhaustive but **inefficient**.
- For `n` propositional variables ‚Üí `2^n` possible models.
- Not scalable for large knowledge bases.
